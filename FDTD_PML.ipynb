    "When an electromagnetic field encounters a target, currents are excited on it, which in turn re-radiate. This process is called “electromagnetic scattering”. Since the Maxwell equations are linear the fields are often decomposed into an _incident_ field $E^{inc}$ and a _scattered_ field $E^{scat}$. The overall field, called the _total_ field $E^{tot}$, is then given as [Eqs. (3.1)]:\n",
